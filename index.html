            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hi there! I'm Wyatt, a 14-year-old STEM enthusiast with big goals. I'm passionate about self-improvement, philosophy (especially stoicism), and robotics. My aim is to make a million dollars before 21, create my own robot, and excel in high school.</p>

            <p>Ever since I was young, I've had a keen interest in technology and innovation. My journey began with simple DIY projects and has grown into more complex undertakings as I've developed my skills. I believe in continuous learning and always pushing the boundaries of what's possible.</p>
            <p>In addition to my technical interests, I'm an avid reader and enjoy exploring different philosophies. Stoicism, in particular, has had a profound impact on my life. It teaches resilience, mindfulness, and the importance of focusing on what you can controlâ€”all principles that I try to incorporate into my daily routine.</p>
            <p>When I'm not working on projects or studying, I enjoy outdoor activities like hiking and cycling. Staying active helps me maintain a balanced lifestyle and provides a fresh perspective on problem-solving.</p>
